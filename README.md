# Crop-Yield-Analyzer-ML
Applying Machine Learning to crop yield analysis leverages historical data on yields, weather, and soil quality to predict future yields and optimize farming strategies. This involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The approach enhances productivity and sustainability, enabling data-driven decisions in agriculture.
